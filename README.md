## Live website
You can check the project running here: [local-listings.herokuapp.com](https://django-classified.herokuapp.com?utm_source=github).

## Why I Made This 
The current economy for contractors is scattered. There needs to be a craigslist-like community that can be accessed by project managers, hiring partners, and other contractors seeking jobs. 

## How It Works
After a user signs in, a contractor can choose a city that they are located in and post a listing for a job they might have or offering their services for hire. On the other end, a job poster can also choose a city and upload the details of the job that they have so contractors and bid and exchange contact info with the job poster.

## The Backend
This site is deployed with Heroku, integrated with PostgreSQL, built with Django.
